Other Notes
======================

Uses Fabric - fabfile.py 

$ fab hello

Hello world!

Use the def's in the fab to call libraries from the command line. Like: "setup", etc 








Face recognition using Tensor Flow
======================
I developed this to learn how Tensor Flow worked. Its no longer being maintained. However you should be able to use the vgg_face model in tensorflow. 

Download network.h5 and place it in vggface directory from 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/7g4nhq4a467jzgv/network.h5?dl=0

Please note that use of VGG Face recognition models must adhere to requirements specified here: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/
